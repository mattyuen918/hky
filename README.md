# NHL Data Project 
This is a project I've written for a mathematical computation course where I utilized pandas in Python to analyze the top 50 scorers in the NHL from the 2007-2008 season up until 2016-2017 season.

All the data comes from [sportingcharts.com](https://www.sportingcharts.com/). 

### Why should we care about hockey data? ### 
Hockey Data is interesting because it can tell a lot about which players are the most skilled by looking at their point totals and the number of times they have reached those numbers. Hockey Data can also tell which players are more likely to fight or rough up their opponents by looking at their penalty minutes in comparison to their point stats. Hockey data are important for scouts as they potentially determine which players get drafted into professional leagues.
